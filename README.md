# Stock Price Prediction using Deep Learning

## Overview

This project focuses on predicting stock prices using deep learning techniques. By leveraging historical stock data, the goal is to develop a model that can forecast future stock prices based on various features and patterns in the dataset.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project comprises historical stock prices, trading volumes, and additional financial indicators for a specific stock or a set of stocks. Key features include:

- Date
- Open Price
- Close Price
- High Price
- Low Price
- Volume
- Additional Financial Indicators

The dataset serves as the foundation for training and evaluating the deep learning model.

## Objectives

1. **Data Preparation:** Clean and preprocess the historical stock data for model training.

2. **Feature Engineering:** Extract relevant features and indicators that contribute to stock price movements.

3. **Model Architecture:** Implement a deep learning model architecture suitable for time series forecasting.

4. **Model Training:** Train the deep learning model on historical data to learn patterns and relationships.

5. **Evaluation:** Assess the model's performance on a test set and evaluate its ability to predict future stock prices.

## Methodology

The project follows a sequential approach, including:

- Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
- Time Series Analysis
- Feature Engineering
- Deep Learning Model Development
- Model Training and Validation
- Model Evaluation

## Results

The project aims to provide accurate and reliable predictions of stock prices based on historical data and identified patterns. The performance of the model can be analyzed using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) or Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
